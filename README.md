- 👋 Hi, I’m Tu Hoang, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Insubria.
- 👀 I’m interested in Privacy and Security for Machine Learning/Deep Learning and Decentralized Systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on privacy-preserving technologies: anonymity (k-anonymity, differential privacy) of knowledge graphs, zero-knowledge proof protocols for blockchain-based applications (proximity marketing, data publishing), and privacy-preserving distributed learning (differential privacy).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on privacy-preserving technologies for machine learning/deep learning and decentralized systems.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me at [contact@tuhoang.me](mailto:contact@tuhoang.me).
